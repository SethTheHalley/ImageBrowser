# ImageBrowser
Mobile application that uses the Imgur Api to browse for images. Takes a search string as user parameter,
then retrieves images that match the query, sorted by most recent. User can also get multiple pages of results.
Clicking on an image takes you to another activity which displays the image as large as it can, 
and shows the image id and title.

Uses retrofit for api calls, picasso for image loading.
